 ## **Economic Analysis of Life Satisfaction Across Europe**  

### **Project Objectives**  
This project aims to analyze life satisfaction across ten European nations by examining key economic and social factors, including:  
- **GDP per capita**  
- **Life expectancy**  
- **Crime rates**  

Through statistical modeling in **R**, we seek to identify correlations and causal relationships between economic conditions and overall well-being. The findings will highlight the limitations of GDP as a sole measure of happiness and provide insights for policymakers.  

### **Data Sources**  
The dataset is compiled from various publicly available sources, including:  
- **World Bank** – GDP per capita and life expectancy data  
- **Eurostat** – Crime rates and social statistics  
- **OECD** – Well-being indicators  
- **Other academic/research sources**  

### **Methodology**  
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning** – Aggregating data from multiple sources and preprocessing for consistency.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizing trends and relationships between variables.  
3. **Statistical Modeling in R** – Applying regression models to examine the impact of economic factors on life satisfaction.  
4. **Data Visualization** – Creating compelling graphs and reports to present key insights.  

### **Key Findings**  
- **Correlation Insights**: Initial results suggest a strong correlation between GDP per capita and life satisfaction but diminishing returns beyond a certain income level.  
- **Crime & Happiness**: Nations with lower crime rates tend to report higher life satisfaction, though this relationship varies across different income groups.  
- **Policy Implications**: The study reinforces that GDP alone is not a sufficient measure of well-being, highlighting the need for broader social policies.  

### **Future Work**  
- Expanding the dataset to include additional well-being indicators.  
- Applying machine learning models for predictive analysis.  
- Comparing European trends with other global regions.
